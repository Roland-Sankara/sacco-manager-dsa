# SACCO-Manager-DSA-System

### Project Brief
The SACCO Manager DSA System is an innovative approach to SACCO (Savings and Credit Cooperative Organization) management that leverages optimized in-memory data structures instead of traditional database-reliant systems. This system is designed to enhance transaction speed and efficiency by carefully selecting and implementing the most suitable data structures for handling deposits, withdrawals, and statement retrievals.

By utilizing advanced Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), the system ensures:
- **Fast and efficient transactions** – Minimizing delays in deposits and withdrawals.
- **Optimized statement retrieval** – Providing quick access to financial records.
- **Data integrity and security** – Maintaining accuracy and protection of members’ financial data.

This project explores the trade-offs between different data structures (such as hash maps, trees, and linked lists) to determine the most effective approach for real-time SACCO transaction processing.

### The Goal
The goal is to create a high-performance, scalable, and secure SACCO management system tailored for financial cooperatives, especially those serving farmers and rural communities.
